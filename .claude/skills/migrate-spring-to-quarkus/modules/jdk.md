# Phase 0: Check JDK Version

Verify that the installed JDK meets the version requirement using the user's prompt VERSION before proceeding with the migration.

## Preconditions

This phase has no preconditions — it must **always** run as the very first step.

## Instructions

- **DO NOT** skip this phase.
- Capture the VERSION parameter from the prompt.
- [ ] Check the JDK version.
- [ ] If the version is **>= VERSION**, mark this phase as passed and proceed to the next phase
- [ ] If the version is **< VERSION** or `java` is not found:
    - **Warn the user**: "JDK VERSION or later is required for this migration. Currently, installed: <detected version or 'none'>. Please install JDK VERSION and ensure it is on your PATH before retrying."
    - **Stop the migration** — do not proceed to any subsequent phase
